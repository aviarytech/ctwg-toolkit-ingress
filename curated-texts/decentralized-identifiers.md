  Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier that enables
  verifiable, self-sovereign digital identity. DIDs are fully under the control
  of the DID subject, independent from any centralized registry, identity
  provider, or certificate authority. They have emerged as a pivotal standard,
  endorsed by the W3C, fostering interoperability and promoting a decentralized
  approach to digital identity verification. This model facilitates a secure and
  verifiable method of establishing digital trust, allowing individuals and
  entities to have greater control and transparency over their digital
  identities.
