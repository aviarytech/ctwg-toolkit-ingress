# Definition
Indirect harm is the intentional or unintentional harm that is experienced by one or more members of the [digital identity ecosystem](https://trustoverip.github.io/hxwg/glossary.html#digital-identity-ecosystem) as a result of events or decisions outside the [jurisdiction](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-glossary#jurisdiction) of the [digital identity ecosystem](https://trustoverip.github.io/hxwg/glossary.html#digital-identity-ecosystem), i.e. in the [external life context](https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary.html#external-life-context). 
Sources of harm include shocks and trends or changes, such as pandemics, deforestation, war, an unexpected regulatory or legislative change, or climate emergency. 
Indirect harms often have physical or infrastructural impacts on all the members of the [digital identity ecosystem](https://trustoverip.github.io/hxwg/glossary.html#digital-identity-ecosystem).  The  harmed [parties](https://essif-lab.github.io/framework/docs/essifLab-glossary#party) have no influence or power over the circumstances or events that lead to that harm.
# Purpose
Distinguish from other types of harm ([direct](https://trustoverip.github.io/hxwg/glossary.html#direct-harm), [contingent](https://trustoverip.github.io/hxwg/glossary.html#contingent-harm), [felt](https://trustoverip.github.io/hxwg/glossary.html#felt-harm)) in the human harms framework.  
# Criterion
The opposite of [direct harm](https://trustoverip.github.io/toip/glossary.html#direct-harm).
# Examples
Loss of internet access due to storm damage to electricity cables, resulting in the failure of a medical device.  Pandemic resulting in the shutdown of the international travel and tourism sector.
