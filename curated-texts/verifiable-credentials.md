  Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are an open standard for digital credentials,
  created to represent information found in physical credentials, such as a
  passport or license, as well as information that has no physical equivalent
  like ownership of a bank account[[23](source)]. They are defined by the World
  Wide Web Consortium (W3C) as a standard data model and representation format
  for expressing cryptographically-verifiable digital credentials[[24](source)].
  A VC uses cryptographic proofs to bind an issuer statement about a subject to
  the subject's identifier, and the resulting document can contain claims
  relative to the subject. In some instances, proofs of different kinds can be
  bundled together within a VC[[25](source)].

## Definition
Verifiable Credentials (VCs) are an open standard for digital credentials, created to represent information found in physical credentials, such as a passport or license, as well as information that has no physical equivalent like ownership of a bank account[[23](source)]. They are defined by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) as a standard data model and representation format for expressing cryptographically-verifiable digital credentials[[24](source)]. A VC uses cryptographic proofs to bind an issuer statement about a subject to the subject's identifier, and the resulting document can contain claims relative to the subject. In some instances, proofs of different kinds can be bundled together within a VC[[25](source)].

## Usage Examples
- VCs can be used as a digital version of titles, diplomas, or certificates, issued by authoritative issuers[[27](source)].
- Verifiable presentations, created from VCs, are packages of evidence built by holders to meet a verifierâ€™s requirements, allowing verifiers to ascertain which issuers have attested something by checking digital signatures against a verifiable data registry, typically a blockchain[[26](source)].
