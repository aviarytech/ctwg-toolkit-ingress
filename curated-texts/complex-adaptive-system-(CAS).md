  A group of semi-autonomous agents who interact in interdependent ways to
  produce system-wide patterns, such that those patterns then influence
  behaviour of the agents. In human systems at all scales, you see patterns that
  emerge from the interactions of agents in that system. Can be applied to
  ecological, social, biological and technical systems.
